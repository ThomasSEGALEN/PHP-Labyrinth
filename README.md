## 1. Wording :  
  
*In this exercise, you will have to program a **maze game** in **PHP**. The maze must be **15 rows** by **15 columns**. To represent it, you will have to make a .txt file, in which you will "draw" a maze with characters.*  
  
*Then, you will have to open this .txt file in PHP, to be able to use it and transcribe the maze into an array.*  
  
*You will then need to be able to display this table in a web page.*  
*When the game starts, you will have to ask for the username, and keep it in memory until the end of the game (by displaying it on the screen).*  
  
*The next step will be to create several links :*  
* *Left* : will have to move your character to the left  
* *Right* : will have to move your character to the right  
* *Top* : will have to move your character to the top  
* *Bottom* : will have to move your character to the bottom  
* *Restart* : will have to restart the game from the beginning  
* *Change nickname* : should allow the player to change his username  
  
*Each time you click on a button, the page will reload and display the new maze if you ckicked on a move button.*  
  
*If you click on Restart, the game will have to reload from the beginning.*  
  
*If you click on Change nickname, the username must be changed with an input field that you will have made available.*  
  
*Don't hesitate to use functions and/or OOP for this exercise.*  
  
*Use sessions and/or cookies and/or BDD to record the progress of the game, so that if you close the page and reopen it, the game will resume where you left off.*  
  
*The maze .txt file should be changeable (not in the middle of a game), and your program should still be running.*  
  
*Onnce your character has reached the exit, you should display a won message, by offering to restart the game.*  
  
  
## 2. Bonus :  
  
*If you feel like a fearless warrior, here are some small features you can add :*  
* Offer several maze levels (several .txt files) and allow the user to choose a maze before starting to play.  
* Add items, randomly placed in the maze. If the character reaches the end without the items, he has lost.  
* Add traps that can appear or disappear randomly during the game.  
* Upload your code on Github, and add the Github link in your deliverables.  
  
  
## 3. Deliverable :  
  
*Deliverables must be sent by email to **k.niel.pro@gmail.com** before May, 18th at 4:00PM.*  
*They must contain all your files in a .zip archive. Please include your last and first name.*  
*No name : 0. No mail received from you : 0.*  
  
  
## 4. Marking criteras :  
  
* *Code cleanliness (indentation, variable names, etc.)* : **5 points**  
* *Code structure (tree structure of files)* : **3 points**  
* *Code optimization* : **2 points**  
* *Operational program* : **30 points**  
* *Delivery time (per day of delay)* : **-5 points**  
* *Points for bonus feature* : **2 points**  
* *Points for bonus OOP use* : **5 points**  
  
*The work is to be done individually.*  
*However, nothing prevents you from help each other on the reflection !*
